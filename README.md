# SwiftMasters

This project aims to create a platform that allows users to interact with Papalote Museo del Niño's exhibits in a more engaging way. The platform will be able to provide information about the exhibits, as well as quizzes and games that will help the user learn more about the exhibit. The platform will also allow the user to keep track of their progress and achievements.
